# Line frequency
This program reads lines in `input.txt` which has duplicate lines, then returns frequency of each unique line.  

My Purpose:  
- I've faced a problem when I was working in HDE Expertise: I need a handy tool for determining which frequency of products.
- There are many ways to do the task. But I want to practice with Go and I have free time to write it.
